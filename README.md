# MatrixMultiplicationUsingCinScilabAPI
Scilab gateway function in C for matrix multiplication 

# Brief :
A C function " multiply(mat1, mat2) " which accepts two double matrices - mat1 & mat2 from Scilab console, checks if the dimension are correct for matrix multiplication, computes the product and displays the product on Scilab console.

# Files :
1. sci_multiply.c is the c-source code file with the neccessary gateway protocols.
2. builder.sce is the scilab script that compiles and the rest of the files are automatically generates because of its execution using 'exec' in the scilab console.

# Output :
![scilabgatewayincmatrixmultiplication](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12222863/26263523/ce081110-3cf6-11e7-98ea-45e5599f11ec.png)
